Inspired by `http://dayswithoutanincident.com` but absolutely static.

## How to

1) Just open an URL: https://izonder.github.io/dayswithoutanincident
2) Enjoy! :)

## Self-hosted

1) Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:izonder/dayswithoutanincident.git`
2) Add your changes
3) Build a docker image `yarn docker`
4) Deploy and run the docker container

## Disclaimer

First it was reproduced using Web Archive snapshots due to the origin being down for a while and entirely rewritten afterwards.
